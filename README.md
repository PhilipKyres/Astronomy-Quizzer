# Astronomy-Quizzer
It was a few days before my astronomy multiple choice final. I had a big bank of questions. I quickly made a simple quizzer program to help me study.  

It asks a question. You answer. It tells you if you are right or wrong and what the correct answer is. Functionality to recursively review incorrectly answered questions.
